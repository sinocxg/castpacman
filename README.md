This is a remade of the classic pacman game. You can use your Android phone to play the game on a big screen TV by casting to the Google Chromecast device. Swipe you finger on your phone screen to guide the little pacman going through the maze. The game supports two phones playing together for more fun.  You will see a funny cut scene when two levels are passed successfully.<br/>
A reminder for you, since there is network latency on WiFi, the player(s) need to judge the pacman's direction on a cross road ahead of time. If it's a bit more difficult for you to play by your phone, you can play the game in your browser(IE is not supported, Chrome, Firefox are recommended) by this URL: https://sinocxg.github.io/castpacman/receiver/pacman.html . Use the arrow keys to control the pacman boy and w, a, s, d to control the pacman girl. <br/>
The game is prototyped from Google doodle for 30th Anniversary of PAC-MAN and open sourced here.<br/>
Having fun!
